# Shape of molecules

## Definition

The arrangement of atoms in a molecule in 3-dimensional space is known as the shape of the molecule.

## Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory (VSEPR)

Due to mutual repulsion among the pairs of electrons around the central atom, the atoms in the molecule/ion arrange themselves in such a way that the repulsion is minimized and the separation is maximized.

## Classifications

| # of electron pairs around the atom | arrangement of electron pairs |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 2                                   | linear                        |
| 3                                   | trigonal planar               |
| 4                                   | tetrahedral                   |
| 5                                   | trigonal bipyramidal          |
| 6                                   | octahedral                    |

Shape of molecule $=$ arrangement of electron pairs iff. all electrons (around the central atom) are bonded pairs.  
Shape of molecule $\neq$ arrangement of electron pairs iff. lone pair exists

**There are bond angles associated with each of the shapes which must be memorized (or must be obtainable from shape).**

## Steps to determine the shape

1. Find the central atom.
2. Count the total number of electron pairs around the central atom.
3. Refer to the above table to get the "should be" shape of the molecule.
4. If all electron pairs are bonded pairs, then the "should be" shape is the actual shape.
5. If lone pair exists, derive actual shape from the "should be" shape.

(Step 5 is a little ambigious but the examples should help? I don't really know at the time of writing.)

## Examples

{{< tabs "examples" >}}
{{< tab "$\ce{BeCl2}$" >}}
### Beryllium Chloride, $\ce{BeCl2}$

![BeCl2 diagram](../becl2_lewis_diagram.png)

1. Central atom is $\ce{Be}$.
2. There are 2 electron pairs around it.
3. "Should be" shape is linear.
4. All electron pairs are bonded so the actual shape is also linear.

The bond angle is $180 \degree$.

{{< tab "$\ce{BCl2}$" >}}
### Boron Chloride, $\ce{BCl3}$

![BCl3 diagram](../bcl3_lewis_diagram.png)

Shape is trigonal planar, and bond angle is $120 \degree$.
{{</ tab >}}
{{< tab "$\ce{CH4}$" >}}
### Methane, $\ce{CH4}$

![CH4 diagram](../ch4_lewis_diagram.png)

Shape is tetrahedral, and bond angle is $109.5 \degree$.
{{</ tab >}}
{{< tab "$\ce{NH3}$" >}}
### Ammonia, $\ce{NH3}$

![ammonia diagram](../ammonia_lewis_diagram.png)

Steps 1-4 for ammonia is the same as done for methane (both have 4 electron pairs) but notice that for methane, going to step 5 was not necessary but for ammonia it is because there exists a lone pair.

5. Actual shape is trigonal pyramidal (derived from tetrahedral).

Don't know how trigonal pyramidal is derived but apparently if you make **1** bonded pair into a lone pair in a tetrahedral molecule then the shape becomes trigonal pyramidal.

Bond angle decreased by $2.5 \degree$ to $107 \degree$.
{{</ tab >}}
{{< tab "$\ce{H2O}$" >}}
### Water, $\ce{H2O}$

![water diagram](../water_lewis_diagram.png)

Again, steps 1-4 is same as methane.

5. Actual shape is bent or v-shaped.

Well, it looks bent. Maybe that's the derivation apparently if you make **2** bonded pairs into lone pairs in a tetrahedral molecule then the shape formed is this.

Bond angle decreases by $2.5 \degree$ again (this is a trend) to $104.5 \degree$.

## Questions

{{< expand "State the shape of $\ce{PCl3}$ and explain why it has this shape." "..." >}}

![PCl3 diagram](../pcl3_dot_cross_diagram.png)

$\ce{PCl3}$ has a trigonal pyramidal shape. The central atom Phosphorus has 3 bonded electron pairs and 1 lone pair. There is repulsion between these electron pairs and they arrange themselves in this way so that the repulsion is minimized and separation is maximized.
