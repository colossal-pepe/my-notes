# About

I'm a very lazy guy and I don't usually give a second thought to any of the notes I write down in class after I get home. So I decided to make this website where I could write everything in pretty fonts and access all my notes from anywhere, anytime as long as I had internet. I also hope working on the website is reason enough for me to finally look at my notes.

## Contribution

For now, I am the only contributor but I do hope that other people will want to pitch in to make this an actual useful resource (and also take some of my work off). I specially welcome folks in A2 to contribute so that I don't have to when I get to A2. If you're interested, find me.
