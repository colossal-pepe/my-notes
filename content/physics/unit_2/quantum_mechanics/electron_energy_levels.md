title: Energy levels of electrons
---

## Concept of energy levels

Electrons in an atom occupy energy levels. The least energetic electrons are closest to the nucleus and are the hardest to extract from the atom. The opposite is true for the more energetic electrons.

## Excitation

When an electron is at its least energy level, we say that it is in its ground state. When we provide sufficient energy, the electron will move to a higher energy level. We now say that 'excitation' ha occurred.

The above figure shows an electron (red) gaining energy and getting excited and go from its ground state ($E_1$) to the next energy level ($E_2$). Then a electron (can be the same or a different one) loses energy and goes to the $E_1$ energy level to replace the excited electron so that the atom remains stable. The loss of energy is depicted with the yellow dot which is a photon.

## Mathematically describing excitation

**From $E_1$ to $E_2$**

Energy gained = Energy at $E_1$ - Energy at $E_2$

$$
\begin{align*}
& \Delta E = E_1 - E_2 \\\
\implies & \Delta E = -14 - (-9) = 5 \text{ eV}
\end{align*}
$$
